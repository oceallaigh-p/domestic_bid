# Flight Attendant Bid Calculation Program  
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Domestic Lines)

<br /> 

## Description

This is a simple Python program that calculates the total pay<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> (hourly pay + per diem) for each line in a flight 
attendant bid packet. It then ranks the lines according to total pay (from greatest to least).


It uses pandas to read in data from Excel. It then creates an instance object for each line in the bid packet and calculates 
the total pay for each line. The line objects are then sorted by total pay (from greatest to least) and converted
back into a pandas DataFrame. The sorted DataFrame is formatted and saved as an HTML file which is then converted 
into a PDF document using pdfkit.
